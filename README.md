Satellites - iOS application
----

I wrote an application in 2012 to make your own solar system. It was never finished or released because I bit off more than I could chew, but it can still be compiled and ran locally and on older iphones.

You can make really big stars and silly plaid planets with moons. The system used n-body mechanics, so it was unnecessarily complex and is prone to breaking apart systems if the parameters are too extreme or unrealistic.
